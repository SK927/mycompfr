      q1:
        q: How do I register?
        a: |
          First, you must create an account on the WCA website. You can do this
          by clicking
          *[Register](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/users/sign_up)*. Once
          you have created your account and confirmed your email address, go to
          the
          *[Register](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP/register)*
          tab of the competition you are interested in, read and follow the
          instructions carefully.
      q2:
        q: |
          I am a member of the AFS, or this is my first competition, and the
          website still asks me to pay, what to do?
        a:
          p1: |
            As indicated on the competition page, no need to pay! The WCA
            website displays the payment page by default since it cannot know if
            your registration is paid by the AFS or not. But rest assured: the
            organizing team will know, control who needs to pay or not and will
            therefore take this information into account when accepting
            registrations.
          p2: |
            If you are not sure if you are an AFS member, check by logging into
            the *[association website](https://www.speedcubingfrance.org/)* and
            then going to your profile.
      q3:
        q: Why am I not on the competitors list?
        a: |
          Please ensure you have read and followed the instructions in the
          *[Register](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP/register)*
          section of the competition. In particular, if you are not a member of
          the AFS (see
          [here](https://www.speedcubingfrance.org/association/adhesion)) or if
          this is not your first competition, please check that you have paid
          for the competition. You may also be on the waiting list. The maximum
          number of participants can be found on the main competition page
          (*[General
          information](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#general-info)*
          tab) and you can see the number of people already accepted on the page
          *[Competitors](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP/registrations)*.
          If you have done everything correctly, paid if necessary, and the
          competition is not filled, be patient. We have to manually accept
          registrations and the organizing teams are not available all the time.
          If you think you have done everything correctly but you are still not
          accepted e after a couple days, then contact us by clicking the
          *[contact](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact?competitionId=ID_COMP&contactRecipient=competition)*
          link on the main competition page, *[General
          information](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#general-info)*
          tab.
      q4:
        q: |
          Can I change the events I registered for after my registration has
          been accepted?
        a: |
          If authorized by the organizing team, you can change your events in
          the
          *[Register](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP/register)*
          section, on the *Register, Choose your events* panel, until the date
          indicated in the registration requirements. If not, you can contact
          the organizing team directly via the
          *[contact](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact?competitionId=ID_COMP&contactRecipient=competition)*
          link on the main competition page, *[General
          Info](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#general-info)*
          tab.
      q5:
        q: I can’t come to the competition anymore? What should I do?
        a:
          p1: |
            Please let us know as soon as you know you can no longer come, by
            emailing via the
            *[contact](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact?competitionId=ID_COMP&contactRecipient=competition)*
            link on the main competition page, *[General
            information](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#general-info)*
            tab.
          p2: |
            You can also unsubscribe on your own by going directly to the
            *[Register](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP/register)*
            section and by scrolling down to the *Registration Details* panel.
          p3: |
            Competitions usually fill up pretty quickly and notifying us of your
            unsubscription allows us to accept someone from the waiting list.
            Your payment will be refunded if you unsubscribe before the date on
            the *[General
            Information](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#general-info)*
            page.
      q6:
        q: Do I have to be very fast to participate?
        a: |
          We recommend that you look at the
          *[Planning](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#competition-schedule)*
          page of the competition. For each event, if you can solve the cube
          faster than the time indicated as *Time Limit*, you are fast enough!
          The events appreciated by beginners (3x3, 2x2, pyraminx, skewb)
          usually have a *time limit* of 10 minutes, which leaves a large
          majority of competitors the opportunity to participate. Many people
          compete for the sole purpose of having fun and breaking their own
          records, without expecting to win.
      q7:
        q: Are there different categories?
        a: |
          All competitors participate together in each event in a single
          category. All ages, genders, nationalities are accepted in
          competition.
      q8:
        q: Do I have to participate in all events?
        a: |
          No. There is a ranking for each event, so you can only participate in
          the ones you like. You will need to select the right images (they will
          then appear in green) when you register.
      q9:
        q: Do I have to bring my own equipment to participate?
        a:
          p1: |
            Make sure you bring at least one cube for each event you have
            registered for and pay attention to it during the competition.
            Thefts are very rare but it is common to take a cube similar to his
            without paying attention.
          p2: |
            Also make sure your cube is allowed. Connected cubes or cubes with
            multiple logos are prohibited for official events. Note that any
            cube with a logo (even if there is only one and you can’t feel it)
            is forbidden for 4x4 and 5x5 blindfolded and 3x3 multi-blind.
          p3: |
            However, there is no need to bring a mat or timer, unless you want
            to use them for your training. Those used for the competition are
            provided by the organizers.
      q10:
        q: Can I only come as a spectator?
        a: |
          es. Unless otherwise stated in the *[General
          Information](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#general-info)*
          of the competition, the competitions are accessible free of charge for
          spectators. You can look at the
          *[Planning](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#competition-schedule)*
          tab to check the times of the events that interest you.
      q11:
        q: What time should I arrive for the competition?
        a: |
          If this is your first competition, we advise you to look at the
          *[Planning](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP#competition-schedule)*
          for the time of the tutorial or check the emails sent by the
          organizing team. In any case, please arrive at the competition about
          30 minutes before the start of your first event. Please note that if
          you arrive after the end of one of your events, we will not be able to
          have you catch up.
      q12:
        q: What should I do when I arrive at the competition?
        a: |
          The first thing to do is to find the welcome and introduce yourself.
          If you are a new competitor, remember to take with you an identity
          document (or any document mentioning your name, first name and date of
          birth) because it may be requested at the welcome desk. The person who
          will welcome you can then guide you and answer your first questions.
      q13:
        q: When can I leave the competition?
        a: |
          It is only necessary to be present when you have to participate or
          judge/ runner/ scramble (an individual schedule will probably be given
          to you at the entrance of the competition or will be available on
          [Competiton
          Groups](https://www.competitiongroups.com/competitions/ID_COMP)). Once
          you have no more tasks, you are free to leave. Remember to check if
          you qualified for subsequent rounds, you never know!
      q14:
        q: Where can I find the results?
        a:
          p1: |
            During the competition, results are entered manually on *[WCA
            Live](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/)* and will be available
            online approximately half an hour after the end of each round.
          p2: |
            At the end of the competition, all the results will be available on
            this same page, but also on the profile of each participant once the
            organizing team has posted the results.
      q15:
        q: How do I create my WCA ID?
        a: |
          The WCA IDs are created automatically as soon as the competition
          results are published (less than a week after the end of the
          competition). The format is: Year of first competition – first 4
          letters of last name – two digits to differentiate between people who
          would have the same information.
      q16:
        q: |
          I usually practice listening to music. Can I use headphones during my
          official solves?
        a: |
          Headphones or earphones are strictly prohibited during official
          solves, so their use would result in disqualification of the solve. If
          the headset is for you to be more focused or less stressed, then you
          can use a noise-cancelling headset only if it has no electronic
          components.
      q17:
        q: Can I film my solves?
        a: |
          It is possible, with a standing camera (GoPro or other) or a mobile
          phone. Be careful though: in the case of a mobile phone or device with
          a screen, it should not be directed at you. Once the solve begins,
          that is, as soon as the inspection has begun, it is strictly forbidden
          to touch its camera, even if it falls, under penalty of
          disqualification of the resolution (DNF).

    title: Registration conditions
    text:
      p1: |
        Registrations are accepted in the order the registrations are completed,
        which means that :
      p2: '[//]: # ''USED TO FORCE NEW LINE : DO NOT REMOVE OR TRANSLATE'''
      p3: |
        * For the people who don't need to pay (new competitors & AFS members),
        we take into account the time when the person **registered**;
      p4: |
        * For the people who need to pay, we take into account the time when the
        person **paid**.
      p5: '[//]: # ''USED TO FORCE NEW LINE : DO NOT REMOVE OR TRANSLATE'''
      p6: |
        Note that your registration will be considered "pending" until it is
        complete (for example if you have not paid when you were due). You will
        not be able to join the list of competitors (or the waiting list if the
        list of competitors is already full), until you have completed your
        registration.
      p7: |
        We would like to point out that registrations are processed manually and
        may therefore take some time, thank you for your patience.

    title: Waiting list
    text:
      p1: |
        If you are on the waiting list, you can check your spot on the
        [registration
        page](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP/register)
        by clicking on "4. Approval by organization team" (even if you didn't
        pay and you didn't have to).
      p2: '[//]: # ''USED TO FORCE NEW LINE : DO NOT REMOVE OR TRANSLATE'''
      p3: |
        People on the waiting list can be accepted until the [deadline indicated
        in the registration
        conditions](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/ID_COMP/register).
      p4: |
        Any competitor accepted on the main list from the waiting list **after**
        the deadline for reimbursement will not be refunded if they can not go
        to the competition. However, we will refund your registration if you did
        not leave the waiting list after the competition.

    title: On the spot registrations
    text:
      accepted:
        p1: |
          On the spot registrations will only be accepted if at least one spot
          is available on the list of competitors **at the time registrations
          close** (**TODO compléter avec date & heure**). In this case, on the
          spot registrations will be accepted, within the competitors limit, in
          the order of arrival and presentation to the referring person
          (**TODO compléter avec nom référent**).
        p2: |
          Otherwise, on the spot registrations will simply not be allowed, even
          if other competitors do not show up for the competition. We therefore
          advise you to register online in order to make sure you have a slot.
      not_accepted: On the spot registrations **will not be accepted**
